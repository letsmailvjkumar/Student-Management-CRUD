# Student-Management-CRUD
Project Description: Student Management System

The Student Management System is a web application that allows users to manage and organize student profiles. It provides features to create, edit, and delete student profiles, as well as search and filter the list of students.

Key Features:

1. Displaying Student List: The application displays a visually appealing table that showcases student profiles with their details such as ID, name, email, age, grade, and degree.

2. Adding Student Profiles: Users can use a form to add new student profiles by entering the necessary information, including name, age, grade, degree, and email. Upon clicking the "Add Student" button, the new student profile is appended to the existing list.

3. Editing Student Profiles: Each student profile in the table is accompanied by an edit icon. When clicked, the form populates with the selected student's details, allowing users to make changes. The "Add Student" button transforms into an "Edit Student" button, enabling users to update the student's information.

4. Deleting Student Profiles: The table provides a delete button for each student profile. Clicking this button removes the corresponding student from the list.

5. Searching and Filtering: The application includes a search box that allows users to filter the list of students based on their name, email, or degree. As users enter search criteria, the table dynamically updates to display the matching student profiles.
